# Alastair Sumner

I am a budding junior developer with a passion for constantly developing my skills and experience.

I have over 7 years experience working within technical pre-sales in the hosting and cloud industry. After 5 years working in a business development role in Manchester I was tasked with opening up and managing a new London office for UKFast that previously had no presence in the South. Working day-in-day-out with developers, engineers, and myriad technical individuals I found myself fascinated by that side of the industry. As such I moved to Claranet as a pre-sales cloud consultant to assist businesses with their digital transformation into public cloud services.

During this role, while gaining an understanding of each client's application stack I found myself drawn towards the applications themselves; how they were built, what their business function was, their benefits as well as their limitations.

I soon realised that this was not something to be ignored, and as a big believer in the notion that you if you love what you do, you won't work a day in your life (as a generalisation rather than any misguided naiviety!), I decided to leave Claranet and enroll on the 16 week intensive [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) course.

## Skills

### Team Work

Extensive experience as working as part of a team both within my previous roles in the hosting industry as well as group projects and pairing sessions within Makers. I have always thrived within a team in developing and working towards a goal. Makers has also taught me that within a development team, like any team, you will have varying skill sets, personailities and ways of working. It is critical to understand all of these elements in order to work as an effective team and get the best from all members.

### Project Management

In my previous roles, it was my job to manage the entire sales cycle from initial contact with the customer to understand requirements right through to handover to our account management team and customer onboarding. These projects ranged from small single server solutions through to multi-million pound public cloud implementations that required a strong level of project management. At both UKFast and Claranet we had various systems of workflow automation, some built in house and other 3rd party tools. 

Throughout Makers we worked using XP/Agile methodologies and within group projects we made use of tools such as Trello, Miro, GitHub in order to create tasks, track progress and document learning to ensure a smooth and structured project flow. 

### Stakeholder Manegement

Many years experience dealing with stakeholders all the way up to C-suite to facilitate new business and grow existing client base. In my roles at UKFast and Claranet my main points of contact would initially be C-suite level as well as members of the tech team, which has given me a solid background in managing clients at many levels. This would be done as face-to-face meetings, white-boarding sessions, and conference calls.

### Leadership

Tasked with opening the London office for UKFast with no real prior presence in London we had a small team down there primarily made up of new business staff with one member of the HR/recruitment team. 

Within my time at Makers, we had a number of group projects that required team members to rotate roles and lead for a section of time. This role required me to emnsure that tasks for the sprint were allocated properly, time scales estimated and that everyone in teh group was feeling motivated and happy with their learning. 

### Communication

Excellent communication skills both written and spoken, which a background in more commercial roles has given me. My day-to-day involved speaking to customers at all levels as well as working internally with engineering, account management, marketing, recruitment.
